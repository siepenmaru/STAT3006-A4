\section{Notes}
Aaroe et al. (2010) stated that the data had been standardised, however cursory examination of the data showed that the means and standard deviations of each feature did not match the expected values of standardised data (i.e. means were not equal to 0, standard deviations not equal to 1), which was odd. Thus, Z-Score normalization was used to standardise the data. This was done in order to ensure all features are scaled similarly, such that features of different scales would not dominate (i.e. in PCA).
